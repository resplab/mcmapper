Description: Tools for mapping the first moment and c-statistic to the parameters of common distributions for risk. This provides a series of numerical methods for extracting parameters of the distributions for risks based on knowing the expected value and c-statistics (e.g., from a published report on the performance of a risk prediction model). This package implements the methodology described in Sadatsafavi et al (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2409.09178>. The core of the package is mcmap(), which takes a pair of (mean, c-statistic) and the distribution type requested. This is a generic interface to more customized functions (mcmap_beta, mcmap_logitnorm, mcmap_probitnorm) for specific distributions.
